# Overview
This repository is for storing the Python 3 code for my thesis. I have developed the forecast model for all-cause mortality, leveraging cause-of-death data through neural networks. For the model performance (forecast accuracy and computing time) assessment, this code file generates multiple models based on the Lee-Carter model and the convolutional neural network (CNN)-based model. 

The code file has the process from data import, pre-processing, exploratory data analysis, modeling, and comparison. Please read the following.
- Some data files are acquired on the local computer and are not readily accessible by googling.
- The code file for the Master's thesis is developed based on the version of Python packages at the time of development.
- I might post the updated code as a separate file for possible enhancement.

If you have any questions, I will try answering on a best-effort basis.
