This repository is for storing the Python 3 code for my thesis. I have developed the forecast model for all-cause mortality, leveraging cause-of-death data through neural networks. For the model performance (forecast accuracy and computing time) assessment, this code file generates multiple models based on Lee-Carter models and the convolutional neural network (CNN)-based models.

The code has the process from data import, pre-processing, exploratory data analysis, modeling and comparison.

Please contact me if you have a question. I will respond on a best effort basis.
